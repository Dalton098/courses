Programming languages are the primary way that most computer scientists interact with computers.  While learning implement programs and algorithms in programming languages indespensible, in this course we delve into the theory of programming languages and their use, design, and implementation. This is an introductory course to the theoretical underpinnings of programming languages.  This course has two primary goals
