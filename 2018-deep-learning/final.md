CS Seminar in Deep Computer Vision and Language

Ursinus College

Alvin Grissom II

# Final Project

For your final project, you will undertake a substantial, creative research project that addresses a problem with deep learning techniques.  The choice of project is open-ended, and groups are encouraged.  Refer to the midterm grading scale for guidelines on how the project will be graded.  The project will be graded primarily in terms of the rigour of the experiments, the depth of the analysis, and the quality of the writing.  Ambitious projects are encouraged.   



## Initial Project Proposal (10 pts)

**Due Nov 8**

Your initial project proposal should clearly define what you intend to study, what your hypothesis is, and cite at least some related work.  It should describe which data you intend to use.  It should be at last one half of a page and contian a timeline for completion.

## Project Plan (20 pts)

**Due Nov 12**

I will provide feedback on your proposals, and, based on this feedback, you will revise and improve the proposal.  This proposal should clearly cite previous work on the topic and have a revised timeline.   Any weaknesses pointed out in my initial review should be addressed

## Final Report and Presentation (70 pts)

**Due on the final exam date**

This report will be at least 4 pages.  Do not insert filler; it will be based on content and not legnth, but if your report is less than four pages, you likely lack sufficient content.  It should follow the same format as the research papers we have read in class.  Again, use the midterm grading scale as a guide.  The report should describe in detail all of your experiments, and you should include links to any code you used.  The code need not be pretty, but it should be understandablre.  You will also give a presentation of not more than 15 minutes.
